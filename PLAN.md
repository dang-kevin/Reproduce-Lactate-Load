# Reproduction template

The goal of this template is to guide documentation of a reproduction of a study in an electronic health record database. Reproductions are assumed to be retrospective observational studies.

This template is based on material from the OSF, as well as from Brandt et al., 2013.

## Title of the study

Increased normalized lactate load is associated with higher mortality in both sepsis and non-sepsis patients: an analysis of the MIMIC-IV database

## Data extraction

### Inclusion/Exclusion criteria

The exclusion criteria were: 1) age < 18 years; 2) not first ICU admission; 3) only one lactate measurement was obtained during the first 24 h; 4) length of ICU stay < 24 h. Patients were divided into the sepsis or non-sepsis group according to the sepsis-3.0 criteria. 

Column names for proposed cohort table:
1. `exclusion_non_adult`
    - exclude patients under 18 years of age
    - mimic_derived.`age`
    - missing values will be assumed to include the patient
2. `exclusion_readmission`
    - exclude if not first ICU admission
    - mimic_core.`admissions`
    - missing values will be assumed to include the patient
3. `exclusion_one_lactate_measurement`
    - exclude if only one lactate measurement was obtained during the first 24 hours
    - mimic_hosp.`labevents`
    - missing values will be assumed to include the patient
4. `exclusion_short_icu_stay`
    - exclude if length of ICU stay less than 24 hours
    - mimic_icu.`icustays`
    - missing values will be assumed to include the patient
5. `sepsis`
    - create a variable to separate the patients into sepsis or non-sepsis group according to sepsis-3.0 criteria
    - mimic_derived.`sepsis3`
    - missing values will be assumed to include the patient
